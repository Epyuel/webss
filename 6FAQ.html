        <h3 class="questions__h3">Who are travel landers?</h3>
        <p class="questions__p"> We help people travel better by connecting curious travelers with exceptional local guides, worldwide. Our mission is to curate the best experiences from every country people travel to.
            What started as an idea in June 2006 became our company in November 1992.
            After an experience visiting the Great Wall of China and meeting some local women who shared some in depth history of the wall in exchange for local souvenirs, 
            Paul and Dave started to think about how to give these women a platform where they can safely connect with travellers to deliver tours that share their vast local knowledge, 
            and be compensated appropriately for it.</p>

    <div class="questions even">
        <h3 class="questions__h3">I’ve not had a response back from my guide, what should I do?</h3>
        <p class="questions__p">spacer We expect guides to reply within 24-48 hours to every traveller inquiry. 
            <em>If it's been more than 48 hours since you sent your email, we encourage you to <a href="3Contact_us.html">contact us</a> to follow up.</em>
            Please note: answers to questions regarding specific details about the tour (i.e. pricing, transportation, itinerary, etc.) must come from the guide.
            Customer Support will assist in facilitating prompt email contact between yourself and the guide; however, to set proper expectations, 
            it should be noted that during high season, response times from the guides will depend on volume of inquiries and bookings. 
            Guides typically conduct their administrative duties during their off-hours in order to deliver the very best tour experiences possible.
            We thank you for your patience and understanding during these busy seasons.</p>
